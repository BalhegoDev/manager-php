I added some plus :>, now you can upload all the content to an excel table and vice-versa
the table is organized by this order: product_name, quantity, price_per_item,time_submited and total_value.

to run this project you gotta use the json-server from npm and run the server with 'php -S localhost:3001'
or any another port than 3000, because of the json-server main port.

i hope that you enjoy my project :)
see ya !
